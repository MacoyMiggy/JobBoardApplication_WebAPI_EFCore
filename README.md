# JobBoardApplication_WebAPI_EFCore
This Job Board Application is created using ASP.NET Core WEB API and Entity Framework Core (REST API Method)
For DB Connections I created database named "JobBoardApp_WebAPI" and two tables named (dbo.Applicant and dbo.JobPositions) using Local DB SQL Server 15.0.41.33 under Visual Studio.
It can be view using SWAGGER for its API's and SCHEMAS.
