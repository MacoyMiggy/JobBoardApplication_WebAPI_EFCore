# JobBoardApplication_WebAPI_EFCore
This Job Board Application is created using ASP.NET Core WEB API and Entity Framework Core (REST API Method)
For DB Connections I created database named "JobBoardApp_WebAPI" and two tables named (dbo.Applicant and dbo.JobPositions) using Local DB SQL Server 15.0.41.33 under Visual Studio.
It can be view using SWAGGER for its API's and SCHEMAS. (https://localhost:7264/swagger/index.html)

Packages I used under MS Visual Studio 2022: 
Bricelam.EntityFrameworkCore.Pluralizer(1.0.0), 
Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer(7.0.12), 
Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCOre.Tools(7.0.12), 
Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Design(6.0.16), 
Swashbuckle.AspNetCore(6.5.0)

For CI/CD process we can do it using Azure DevOps Build and Release Pipeline configuration, however I can't configured it using our paid and license DevOps tools on my current company. 
But rest assured that I can share my technical knowledge about Azure DevOps CICD Process using TDD (SpecFlow Gherkin + XUnit), SonarCloud(CleanCode) and Ranorex Automation (UAT)
